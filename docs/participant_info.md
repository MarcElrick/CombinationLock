# Participant Instrutions

This process will be explained to you by the experimenter. You will be asked to carry out this process a total of six times. The process is as follows:

## Prerequisites

Prior to conducting the experiment, you will be given the following:

- A list of passwords.

- A demonstration of how the relevant authentication method works.

- Time to familiarise yourself with the relevant authentication method.

Please inform the experimenter when you are ready to proceeed.

## Procedure

### Usability Evaluation

For each of the 5 passwords on your list, do the following:

- Enter the password.
  
  - If you entered the password correctly, you may advance to repeat this step for all other passwords.
  
  - If you entered the password incorrectly, repeat until you have entered it correctly.

You will advance through the list 3 times until you have correctly entered a total of 30 passwords.

### User Survey

You will then be presented with a survey to fill out. This will be mostly Likert-scale style questions on how much you agree or disagree with certain statements related to your experience with the authentication method.

### Video Attack

Finally, you will be shown several videos of someone unlocking a device using the method with which you have been familliarised. You will see each video once, and your goal will be to try to figure out the person's password from what you have seen.
